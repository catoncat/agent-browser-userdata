+### Patchright Version
+
+The [`agent-browser-with-userdata-patchright`](https://github.com/BUNotesAI/agent-browser-userdata/tree/agent-browser-with-userdata-patchright) branch replaces Playwright with [Patchright](https://github.com/AhmedMostafa16/patchright) - a patched version of Playwright that helps bypass bot detection. Use this branch if you're encountering issues with websites that block automation.
